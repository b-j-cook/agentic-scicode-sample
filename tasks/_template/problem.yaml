# =============================================================================
# Task Definition Template
# =============================================================================
#
# HOW TO CREATE A NEW TASK:
# 1. Run: python compile_tasks.py new my_task_name
#    This copies the template to a new folder.
# 2. Fill in all fields marked with TODO below
# 3. Add step files in steps/ directory (see 01_step_name.py for format)
# 4. (Optional) Add background files in background/ directory if needed
# 5. Run: python compile_tasks.py validate tasks/your_task_folder/
# 6. Run: python compile_tasks.py compile tasks/your_task_folder/
#
# NAMING CONVENTION:
# Use descriptive names instead of numbers to avoid merge conflicts!
# Examples:
#   - lennard_jones_potential
#   - protein_folding_energy
#   - molecular_dynamics_sim
#   - fourier_transform_solver
#
# =============================================================================

# TODO: Unique identifier - use descriptive names, not numbers!
# This becomes the problem_id in the evaluation system
problem_id: "YOUR_TASK_NAME"

# TODO: Human-readable name (spaces allowed)
problem_name: "Your Problem Title"

# TODO: Domain/category for organization
domain: "your_domain"

# TODO: Main problem description
# Describe the overall goal - what problem are we solving?
description: |
  [Describe the problem here]
  
  [What real-world application does this address?]
  
  [What will the complete solution accomplish?]

# TODO: Input/Output specification
# This becomes the docstring shown in prompts

  [Main Problem Title]
  
  [Overall description of what the complete solution does]
  
  Parameters:
  -----------
  [List main parameters that appear across sub-steps]
  
  Returns:
  --------
  [What the final integrated solution returns]
  
  Units:
  ------
  [Specify units used throughout - be consistent!]

# TODO: Python dependencies
# These are added as imports at the top of generated code
dependencies:
  - import numpy as np
  # Add more as needed:
  # - import scipy as sp
  # - from scipy.constants import Avogadro
  # - import math

# TODO: List of step files (in order)
# Reference files in steps/ directory WITHOUT the .py extension
# Steps are solved sequentially - each can use functions from previous steps
steps:
  - 01_step_name
  # - 02_step_name
  # - 03_step_name
  # Add more steps as needed

# OPTIONAL: Background context for the main problem
# Leave empty if not needed
